# Abstract

A Windshield Wiper is an essential tool in an automobile to have a clear vision by eliminating debris and enabling driving through rain and snow.
This project demonstrates the Wiper Control System in automobiles using a STM32F4xx-Discovery board. The wiper action is demonstrated with the aid of 4 LED's, Red, Blue, Green, Orange. To indicate the ignition the Red LED glows on pressing the switch. The Blue, Green, and Orange blink sequentially in a clockwise and counter-clockwise direction to represent wiper action.
